## Research and Reading

I've been doing a lot of reading and research regarding the Fusor. I have some things I want to try with it, rather than just simply ticking the box on achieving fusion, and that means I need some new ideas. This page is a listing of information, math, videos, books, articles etc. that I have read and I think are generally pertinent towards this goal. I'm really not too sure how to organize all this, it's not like I have some sort of system setup, basically if I think a bit of information is interesting I read/watch/engage with it and then I put it up here. Included are things about modern science, ancient science, mathematics, hoaxes, frauds, engineering, sociology, and on and on. I'm slowly adding everything I've done so far, and I'll try to include short comments where appropriate, but as of right now the list is incomplete! Rest assured I found everything here interesting. 

Currently Reading - [The Forgotten Revolution: How Science Was Born in 300 BC and Why it Had to be Reborn](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/3540200681/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=15121&creative=330641&creativeASIN=3540200681&linkCode=as2&tag=nkrause-20&linkId=6b1b4303ea4c2b0ac45a1005db0a5e8c)

## How Does Invention Occur?
**Videos**
- [Everything is a Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPERZDfyWc) - Kirby Ferguson - A wonderful video about how the essence of creativity and innovation is recombination. I have watched this multiple times. 

**Interviews**
- [Conversations with Tyler - Peter Thiel](https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/peter-thiel/) - Tyler Cowen's interview series is always worth your time, but in particular this discussion with Peter Thiel is fascinating. Thiel's thesis around technological stagnation is I think rather well known at this point, and here you get to listen to a very good summary of it. The first step in solving a problem is understanding that you have one. 

### History + Sociology
**Books**
- [The Glass Bathyscaphe](https://amzn.to/33G9bNs) - Alan Macfarlane and Penny Tweedie - A good read about how glass made many technologies possible. Imagine chemistry without glassware, biology without the optics of the microscope, it's impossible. A lot of fascinating history is included, what is the link between better bureaucracy and reading glasses? What about perspective in art, the window and projective geometry in mathematics? Very much worth reading.
- [The Invention of the Modern World](https://amzn.to/3og2sDa) - Alan Macfarlane - A series of essays by the Cambridge anthropologist on how England and Great Britain came to be at the center of industrialization and modernization. Lots of fascinating tidbits about the relationship between religion and men, the pre-existing mechanisation with waterwheels and windmills and the social structure of the society. 
- [Skunk Works](https://amzn.to/3w7DUPz) - Ben R. Rich and Leo Janos - An overview of one of the most innovative areas of aircraft design in the US. Lots of great information about the development of the U2 and everyone's favourite the SR-71. Goes into some detail about the first stealth fighter and how the whole Skunkworks was organized. Of note is the frustration with increasing security requirements that appeared from the 70's onwards. 
- [Operation Paperclip](https://amzn.to/3ohdnfW) - Annie Jacobsen - I have no clue if this is the best history of operation paperclip but it seems alright. A good overview of how the US brought over numerous Nazi scientists in the immediate aftermath of the second world war and put them to work. Everyone knows about Werner Von Braun (who cares where the rockets come down?) and the role they played in the Apollo program, but lots of other details are fleshed out. Nerve gas, human exposure experiments to cold, plenty of nasty individuals came over!
- [Masters of Doom](https://amzn.to/3uNtB32) - David Kushner - A fascinating history of the early days of id software, makers of Doom. I spent a lot of time playing this game in my youth and its fascinating to me just how young Carmack and his compatriots were. There's a wonderful line in the book when they're talking about key-man insurance for the company "no one else matters". How far back would computer graphics be without Carmack? Perhaps Peter Thiel's heroic vision of technology is the right one. 
- [The Decadent Society](https://amzn.to/3eLgEkE) - Ross Douthat - An essay about America and why she is the way she is right now. Probably best read in conjunction with Tyler Cowen's complacent class. Many comparisons to Rome and its fall from grace. Perhaps the best explanation of the current navel gazing American politics seems to be engaged in.
- [The Origins of AIDS](https://amzn.to/2RjLzLV) - Jacques Pepin - When is a plague man-made and when is it not? A very thorough investigation into the origins of a slow burning plague. The construction of railways, hunting for game meat, poorly sterilized needles in public health campaigns, it's all in here. Very well written and laid out. 
- [Everyday Technology](https://amzn.to/3eKPLgv) - David Arnold - Technology often means large projects to people. Think Apollo or the Manhattan Project, but in terms of day to day life it's often much more basic objects that create enduring change. We can no longer put a man on the moon, but everyone has a television in their house. This book looks at technological change in India through implements like the typewriter and sewing machine, very much worth reading to shift one's perspective on what real innovation for society looks like. 
- [Cathedral Forge and Waterwheel](https://amzn.to/3ht7evQ) - Frances and Joseph Gies - 
- [Inviting Disaster - Lessons from the Edge of Technology](https://amzn.to/3w4fB56) - James R. Chiles - 
- [The Glass Cage](https://amzn.to/3og3fUE) - Nicholas Carr - 
- [Why Most Things Fail](https://amzn.to/33QtNlX) - Paul Ormerod - 
- [Things Fall Apart](https://amzn.to/3bn7uJ1) - Chinua Achebe - 
- [Craeft](https://amzn.to/33HhWqj) - Alexander Langlands - 
- [Cognitive Gadgets](https://amzn.to/2RPtZzk) - Cecilia Hayes - 
- [Regional Advantage](https://amzn.to/3uQAD74) - Anna Lee Saxenian - 
- [The Complacent Class](https://amzn.to/3ePiC3B) - Tyler Cowen -

### Biography - Auto and Otherwise
**Books**
- [To Mars With Love](https://www.tomarswithlove.com/) - Patricia Ann Straat - A wonderful story about the development of one of the life detection experiments on the Viking Lander. Known as the Labelled Release experiment, this book details its design and invention and lays out the case that life was actually detected by the device. Sadly the author passed away in October of last year, this whole book is fascinating and deserves to be more widely read.  
- [Grace Hopper and the Invention of the Information Age](https://amzn.to/3oiCIGl) - Kurt Beyer - 
- [The Forgotten Genius of Oliver Heaviside](https://amzn.to/3hxpkwV) - Basil Mahon - It is stunning how many of the methods modern Electrical Engineers use to solve problems are due to the genius of a single man. 
- [The Man Who Changed Everything](https://amzn.to/3fdm6M8) - Basil Mahon -
- [True Genius - The Life and Science of John Bardeen](https://amzn.to/33N5oOp) - Lillian Hodeson and Vicki Daitch - One thing I find very odd is how rarely the midwest of the United States is talked about as a hotbed of invention. People often like to discuss the Hungarians who built the bomb, and their undeniable genius, or Silicon Valley. But the midwest of the US birthed Claude Shannon, Robert Noyce, John Bardeen, The Wright Brothers, and Philo Farnsworth, to name a few. This book is a fascinating look at the Electrical Engineer who invented the transistor and then explained Type 1 Superconductivity, winning Nobel Prizes for both. His background, and his education was all through American institutions of Pre-War and immediate Post-War vintage. Forget DARPA, what social structures laid the groundwork for his work? We should want more of it.

## Techniques of Invention

### Programming
**Books**
- [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://amzn.to/3y9ZrJb) - David Thomas and Andrew Hunt - 
- [Thinking Forth](https://amzn.to/2SQZBVP) - Leo Brodie - 
- [Coders at Work](https://amzn.to/3hq63gy) - Peter Seibel - 

### Math
**Books**
- [A Programmer's Introduction to Mathematics](https://amzn.to/3tMix4L) - Jeremy Kun - I've read through 3/4 (8/10? Something like that) of this book. I've also done none of the exercises (my kingdom for an answer key!). A very nice read, in particular I really enjoyed the derivation of the wave equation and the general conversational tone of the book. Very reassuring to hear that yes learning new math is supposed to be slow. 
- [Linear and Geometric Algebra](https://amzn.to/33JlI2B) - Dr. Alan Macdonald - I struggled in my first Linear Algebra course and just scraped through. I read most of this book over the course of a summer. I took my time and would work through the exercises as described, and for the first time, things like a basis and span and all these technical definitions really started to click! I keep meaning to finish the book and work through the second volume on vector and geometric calculus. 
- [Quick Calculus](https://amzn.to/3uSLEVp) - Daniel Kleppner and Norman Ramsey - I worked through this calculus book the summer after graduating from SAIT based on a recommendation in the Art of Electronics. Very well done and a nice review.
- [Calculus Made Easy](https://calculusmadeeasy.org/) - Silvanus P. Thompson - One of the best teaching books I've ever read. I worked through the whole book in the fall of 2017, it was a wonderful review and provided some of the best ways intuitive ways of thinking about the integral and derivative as a beginner. If you want to refresh your calculus or learn it for the first time, there is no better book. 

**Papers**

- [A Revolution in Mathematics? What Really Happened a Century Ago]() - Frank Quinn - 


**Courses**
- [Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycJEoqmQvwg&list=PLbN57C5Zdl6j_qJA-pARJnKsmROzPnO9V) -Dr. Steven Strogatz - I found this series hugely helpful when I was working through the material in my Intermediate Ordinary Differential Equations course at UVic. I haven't watched every single video, but I've been through most. The associated textbook is very good as well. 
- [The Fourier Transform and its Applications](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/EE261) - Dr. Brad Osgood - I ran through all of these lectures in the summer of 2020 and took notes after they were recommended by Jeremy Kun in his book. They're a great series and placed the Fourier Transform in context for me. 
- [Topology and Geometry](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTBqohhFNBE_09L0i-lf3fYXF5woAbrzJ) - Dr. Tadashi Tokieda - A fantastic course and a very good introduction to Topology. Again, I watched all the videos and took notes. It familiarized me with the field and also provided tremendous insight in to what mathematics really is and how it operates. To quote Dr. Tokieda: "that's what mathematics is, an analogy". 
- [Differential Forms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaWj0WxUxGg&list=PL22w63XsKjqzQZtDZO_9s2HEMRJnaOTX7&index=1) - Dr. Michael Penn - A great overview of differential forms that I completed in the spring of 2021. There's some hints that more videos might be added in the future, but currently it was a great introduction to modern methods of expressing Maxwell's Equations. 
- [Particle in Cell Fundamentals](https://www.particleincell.com/pic-fundamentals/) - - A great introduction to particle in cell simulations for plasmas. I was able to purchase the course as a student at a discount for $25. I took notes of all the videos and it was a great help for writing my own initial PIC simulation. 
- [Center Manifolds, Normal Forms and Bifurcations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUeHTafWecAVblNx278wBxkIQXw7iJws3) - Dr. Shane Ross - Currently halfway through this series of videos taking notes as I go.
- [Imaginary Numbers are Real](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiaHhY2iBX9g6KIvZ_703G3KJXapKkNaF) - Welch Labs - Complex numbers appear everywhere in electrical engineering and since I didn't feel especially confident with them after completing my SAIT diploma I worked through this series of videos along with the associated workbook. A wonderful short tutorial on complex numbers that goes all the way up to advanced concepts and lets you dip your toe in to some fascinating mathematics. 

**Websites**
- [Lee Lady's Mathematical Website](http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~lee/) - Dr. Lee Lady - A great website that provides a ton of context about learning math. In particular his descriptions of how he proved some of his theorems early on, and general commentary about how to teach and learn math is invaluable. His essay on "How to do Mathematical Research" is worth reading repeatedly.
 

### Engineering
**Books**

- [Invention by Design](https://amzn.to/3eJKRR4) - Henry Petroski - 
- [The Art of Doing Science and Engineering]() - Richard Hamming - 

### Finance
The inclusion of finance might seem a little curious, but I think it's a hugely important place to read about invention and in particular the application and misapplication of mathematical models to reality. I would also note that I think a lot of very talented people have sniffed out the rot in modern Academia (from the 70's on), and Wall St. has long been willing to pay people a lot of money for their talents. It's always worthwhile to read smart people, and so you put two and two together and you end up here.

**Interviews**
-[The Portal - Roger Penrose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg93Dm-vYc8) - I normally try and listen to podcasts that are in the interviewer's area of expertise since they tend to be most interesting (Joe Rogan on fighting and comedy for example), and this is one of the few interviews with a mathematical physicist that didn't drive me absolutely bananas. Wonderful to listen to a Nobel prize winner discuss mathematics on a level that isn't just for the layman, very enlightening even if I couldn't follow a lot of it.
