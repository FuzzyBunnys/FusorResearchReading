## Research and Reading

I've been doing a lot of reading and research regarding the Fusor. I have some things I want to try with it, rather than just simply ticking the box on achieving fusion, and that means I need some new ideas. This page is a listing of information, math, videos, books, articles etc. that I have read and I think are generally pertinent towards this goal. I'm really not too sure how to organize all this, it's not like I have some sort of system setup, basically if I think a bit of information is interesting I read/watch/engage with it and then I put it up here. Included are things about modern science, ancient science, mathematics, hoaxes, frauds, engineering, sociology, and on and on. I'm slowly adding everything I've done so far, and I'll try to include short comments where appropriate, but as of right now the list is incomplete! Rest assured I found everything here interesting.

## How Does Invention Occur?
- [Everything is a Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPERZDfyWc) - Kirby Ferguson - A wonderful video about how the essence of creativity and innovation is recombination. I have watched this multiple times.

## Techniques of Invention

- [Thinking Forth]()
- [Coders at Work]()

### Math
- [The Fourier Transform and its Applications](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/EE261)
- [Topology and Geometry](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTBqohhFNBE_09L0i-lf3fYXF5woAbrzJ)

- [Particle in Cell Fundamentals](https://www.particleincell.com/pic-fundamentals/)
### Engineering
- [Debugging]()
### Finance
The inclusion of finance might seem a little curious, but I think it's a hugely important place to read about invention and in particular the application and misapplication of mathematical models to reality. I would also note that I think a lot of very talented people have sniffed out the rot in modern Academia (from the 70's on), and Wall St. has long been willing to pay people a lot of money for their talents. It's always worthwhile to read smart people, and so you put two and two together and you end up here.
