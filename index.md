## Research and Reading

I've been doing a lot of reading and research regarding the Fusor. I have some things I want to try with it, rather than just simply ticking the box on achieving fusion, and that means I need some new ideas. This page is a listing of information, math, videos, books, articles etc. that I have read and I think are generally pertinent towards this goal. I'm really not too sure how to organize all this, it's not like I have some sort of system setup, basically if I think a bit of information is interesting I read/watch/engage with it and then I put it up here. Included are things about modern science, ancient science, mathematics, hoaxes, frauds, engineering, sociology, and on and on. I'm slowly adding everything I've done so far, and I'll try to include short comments where appropriate, but as of right now the list is incomplete! Rest assured I found everything here interesting. 

Currently Reading - [The Forgotten Revolution: How Science Was Born in 300 BC and Why it Had to be Reborn](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/3540200681/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=15121&creative=330641&creativeASIN=3540200681&linkCode=as2&tag=nkrause-20&linkId=6b1b4303ea4c2b0ac45a1005db0a5e8c)

## How Does Invention Occur?
**Videos**
- [Everything is a Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPERZDfyWc) - Kirby Ferguson - A wonderful video about how the essence of creativity and innovation is recombination. I have watched this multiple times. 
- [Looms, Weaving and Cumulative Culture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi7rYDkdSBA) - Christopher Buckley - Fascinating 3-part series about the cultural transmission of knowledge in the context of looms and weaving in southeast asia. Lots of great tidbits. 

**Interviews**
- [Conversations with Tyler - Peter Thiel](https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/peter-thiel/) - Tyler Cowen's interview series is always worth your time, but in particular this discussion with Peter Thiel is fascinating. Thiel's thesis around technological stagnation is I think rather well known at this point, and here you get to listen to a very good summary of it. The first step in solving a problem is understanding that you have one. 
- [The Tim Ferriss Show - Jerry Seinfeld](https://tim.blog/2020/12/08/jerry-seinfeld/) - I think a lot of creative work has some fundamental similarities. Making a new scientific theory, creating a work of art, writing a novel, or making new jokes, these are all making a new thing. Jerry Seinfeld in particular has had a very long creative career, and he's handled the transition from network TV to the internet very well. I think his Comedians in Cars getting Coffee series is the most youtubey professional show I've ever watched. So in that vein, why not listen to the guy to figure out how he's stayed so creatively productive for so long?

### History + Sociology
**Books**
- [The Glass Bathyscaphe](https://amzn.to/33G9bNs) - Alan Macfarlane and Penny Tweedie - A good read about how glass made many technologies possible. Imagine chemistry without glassware, biology without the optics of the microscope, it's impossible. A lot of fascinating history is included, what is the link between better bureaucracy and reading glasses? What about perspective in art, the window and projective geometry in mathematics? Very much worth reading.
- [The Invention of the Modern World](https://amzn.to/3og2sDa) - Alan Macfarlane - A series of essays by the Cambridge anthropologist on how England and Great Britain came to be at the center of industrialization and modernization. Lots of fascinating tidbits about the relationship between religion and men, the pre-existing mechanisation with waterwheels and windmills and the social structure of the society. 
- [Skunk Works](https://amzn.to/3w7DUPz) - Ben R. Rich and Leo Janos - An overview of one of the most innovative areas of aircraft design in the US. Lots of great information about the development of the U2 and everyone's favourite the SR-71. Goes into some detail about the first stealth fighter and how the whole Skunkworks was organized. Of note is the frustration with increasing security requirements that appeared from the 70's onwards. 
- [Operation Paperclip](https://amzn.to/3ohdnfW) - Annie Jacobsen - I have no clue if this is the best history of operation paperclip but it seems alright. A good overview of how the US brought over numerous Nazi scientists in the immediate aftermath of the second world war and put them to work. Everyone knows about Werner Von Braun (who cares where the rockets come down?) and the role they played in the Apollo program, but lots of other details are fleshed out. Nerve gas, human exposure experiments to cold, plenty of nasty individuals came over!
- [Masters of Doom](https://amzn.to/3uNtB32) - David Kushner - A fascinating history of the early days of id software, makers of Doom. I spent a lot of time playing this game in my youth and its crazy to me just how young Carmack and his compatriots were. There's a wonderful line in the book when they're talking about key-man insurance for the company, "no one else matters". How far back would computer graphics be without Carmack? Perhaps Peter Thiel's heroic vision of technology is the right one. 
- [The Decadent Society](https://amzn.to/3eLgEkE) - Ross Douthat - An essay about America and why she is the way she is right now. Probably best read in conjunction with Tyler Cowen's complacent class. Many comparisons to Rome and its fall from grace. Perhaps the best explanation of the current navel gazing American politics seems to be engaged in.
- [The Origins of AIDS](https://amzn.to/2RjLzLV) - Jacques Pepin - When is a plague man-made and when is it not? A very thorough investigation into the origins of a slow burning disease. The construction of railways, hunting for game meat, poorly sterilized needles in public health campaigns, it's all in here. Very well written and laid out. 
- [Everyday Technology](https://amzn.to/3eKPLgv) - David Arnold - Technology often means large projects to people. Think Apollo or the Manhattan Project, but in terms of day to day life it's often much more basic objects that create enduring change. We can no longer put a man on the moon, but everyone has a television in their house. This book looks at technological change in India through implements like the typewriter and sewing machine, very much worth reading to shift one's perspective on what real innovation for society looks like. 
- [Cathedral Forge and Waterwheel](https://amzn.to/3ht7evQ) - Frances and Joseph Gies - After the collapse of Greece and Rome, and the passage of the Dark Ages, how did technology progress during the middle ages? The magnificent cathedrals of Europe show there was clearly some work ongoing, and the suits of armour of knights show a different type of technology. Lots of fascinating tidbits about guilds, and how things were passed from generation to generation. 
- [Inviting Disaster - Lessons from the Edge of Technology](https://amzn.to/3w4fB56) - James R. Chiles - How do complicated systems fail and what can we do to prevent it? A series of case studies from the Ocean Ranger, to Apollo 13 show how systems of organization fail. Lots of fascinating facts and also a healthy dose of realism about how to contain the human element inherent in all of these failings. 
- [The Glass Cage](https://amzn.to/3og3fUE) - Nicholas Carr - Lots of discussions around automation are pretty frustrating to read. This one isn't, lots of deep insight into problems of automation. For example, pilots build skill while flying a plane manually, that skill helps them when they get into a serious problem. Autopilots can handle most of the standard flying tasks now, but are unable to deal with difficult edge cases. So we have a system that atrophies the skill of the pilots but hands over control to them at the worst possible time. Not ideal. How does this affect drivers with the current proliferation of driver assist technology? The book also contains a really interesting perspective on video games. 
- [Why Most Things Fail](https://amzn.to/33QtNlX) - Paul Ormerod - I found this book frustrating as I wanted there to be more too it, but it's a great overview of how many plans of man simply don't work out. Businesses routinely collapse completely, and figuring out how to make something that endures is very very hard. 
- [Things Fall Apart](https://amzn.to/3bn7uJ1) - Chinua Achebe - When a man commits fully to his own culture and reaps the rewards only to see it utterly eroded by forces beyond his comprehension how does he respond? I think this is a tale of tragedy in the real world, but perhaps in the world of science it is the way things should be.  
- [Craeft](https://amzn.to/33HhWqj) - Alexander Langlands - In a similar vein as Everyday Technology but less academic and more popular. How is technological information transmitted across generations when the modern superstructure of public research universities and accreditation for professional careers doesn't exist? Lots of fascinating discussion about everything from how to make bee hives to fences. 
- [Cognitive Gadgets](https://amzn.to/2RPtZzk) - Cecilia Hayes - How do we learn? [Plagiarism!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXlfXirQF3A). A very good book about how you should learn. Copying other people's work is highly underrated as a tool for improving. What else is a bibliography but a tool to allow you to figure out who to mimic? 
- [Regional Advantage](https://amzn.to/3uQAD74) - Anna Lee Saxenian - How did Silicon Valley in the 50's 60's and 70's operate? What social norms drove the rapid improvement in transistor technology that gave us our modern world? Lot's of worthwhile tidbits, key amongst them was that employees were not punished for leaving and starting their own companies. Very often their previous employer would rehire them if the company failed, or do business with them if the new company produced something worthwhile. 
- [The Complacent Class](https://amzn.to/3ePiC3B) - Tyler Cowen - Many things I did not know about the recent history of the US I learned in this book. How many bombings were taking place in America in the early 70s? Lots, like lots per day lots. It makes the argument that all of this turmoil was solved by essentially policing America, and that this was a democratic decision. Interesting in the context of current debates about police brutality and possible solutions. 
- [How the Scots Invented the Modern World](https://amzn.to/3tLuYO9) - Arthur Herman - 
- [Scientific Freedom the Elixir of Civilization](https://amzn.to/3tPj2uZ) - Donald Braben - I'm not too sure what to make of this book. It's an updated call for more freedom for scientists so that they can produce good research. The author certainly has the track record to back it up, but critically seems to have only been able to achieve his aims because some benevolent managers at an oil company saw fit to fund him. Obviously the support was tempermental and when management changed it disappeared. That being said I don't see how any government funded research will avoid the pressures he identifies as being destructive to this high quality research. 
- [The HP Way](https://amzn.to/3tSs4Yf) - David Packard - Before it became a brand on personal computers, HP made lots of critical tools for electrical engineers. In fact Steve Wozniak got his start there. That part of the company now survives as Agilent I believe, but this is a description of how such an innovative company came to be. Lots of neat tidbits about California in the pre-war and post-war era. 
- [Dealers of Lightning](https://amzn.to/3tSWKIw) - Michael A Hiltzik - The sort of standard history of Xerox PARC and how they went about defining all of the desktop computer technology we use today. My favourite tidbit is that the secretaries of executives immediately understood the utility of the new computer, while their bosses did not. 
- [The Idea Factory](https://amzn.to/3tSWKIw) - Jon Gertner - Everything came out of Bell Labs, the transistor, the CCD, the cell phone and on and on. This is a wonderful history of the whole place and how it did what it did. 
- [Where Wizards Stay Up Late](https://amzn.to/3w8mcLQ) - Katie Hafner - 
- [Arts and Minds](https://amzn.to/344cwpT) - Dr. Anton Howes - One of the things that is a little curious with England's industrialization is that it happened with so little state support. France spent a lot on promoting industry and England did not, why then did England industrialize first? Part of the answer might lie in the social structures that promoted innovation. Enter this book, worth reading, and I should add, Anton Howes [newsletter/blog](https://antonhowes.substack.com/welcome) is also very much worth subscribing too. 

**Articles**
- [A Fractal of Lies](https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/a-fractal-of-lies)


### Biography - Auto and Otherwise
**Books**
- [To Mars With Love](https://www.tomarswithlove.com/) - Patricia Ann Straat - A wonderful story about the development of one of the life detection experiments on the Viking Lander. Known as the Labelled Release experiment, this book details its design and invention and lays out the case that life was actually detected by the device. Sadly the author passed away in October of last year, this whole book is fascinating and deserves to be more widely read.  
- [Grace Hopper and the Invention of the Information Age](https://amzn.to/3oiCIGl) - Kurt Beyer - The [Harvard series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Mark_I) of computing devices were one of a number of early computing devices. Incidentally the first was directly influenced by Charles Babbage's machine since Howard Aitken studied a demonstration machine Babbage's son had brought to Harvard. Out of this research group came Grace Hopper, who amongst other things wrote one of the first COBOL compilers. So just a wee bit influential on the development of programming languages. Great read about how she developed the talents and skills working with an enormous physical device and the influences that had on more theoretical work like compiler construction.
- [The Forgotten Genius of Oliver Heaviside](https://amzn.to/3hxpkwV) - Basil Mahon - It is stunning how many of the methods modern Electrical Engineers use to solve problems are due to the genius of a single man. Working mostly alone from a young age, he basically transformed James Maxwell's equations into the modern tools that are used today. Never paid, rarely acknowledged and full of plenty of curious quirks. Maybe you hear of him today when the Heaviside function is used, but his Operational Calculus has been subsumed in to Laplace method's after it was put on a more rigorous mathematical footing in the 1920's.  
- [The Man Who Changed Everything](https://amzn.to/3fdm6M8) - Basil Mahon - James Clerk Maxwell, the great genius of the 19th century whose theoretical explanation of electromagnetic waves laid the foundation of modern society. A wonderful view in to his slightly tragic life. 
- [True Genius - The Life and Science of John Bardeen](https://amzn.to/33N5oOp) - Lillian Hodeson and Vicki Daitch - One thing I find very odd is how rarely the midwest of the United States is talked about as a hotbed of invention. People often like to discuss the Hungarians who built the bomb, and their undeniable genius, or Silicon Valley. But the midwest of the US birthed Claude Shannon, Robert Noyce, John Bardeen, The Wright Brothers, and Philo Farnsworth, to name a few. This book is a fascinating look at the Electrical Engineer who invented the transistor and then explained Type 1 Superconductivity, winning Nobel Prizes for both. His background, and his education was all through American institutions of Pre-War and immediate Post-War vintage. Forget DARPA, what social structures laid the groundwork for his work? We should want more of it.  
- [The Dream Machine](https://amzn.to/3hsdWlY) - M. Mitchell Waldorp - The invention of the internet is one of the larger technological changes that has been undertaken in the modern era. The man in charge of the research program that created it's initial form, ARPAnet, is described in this book. Well worth reading for a perspective on how the research was organized and how the talented individuals who worked on these projects were brought together. 
- [The Strangest Man](https://amzn.to/3wanNRc) - Graham Farmelo - 
- [Einstein: His Life and Universe](https://amzn.to/2Rmj0NV) - Walter Isaacson - It's a biography of Einstein, what more needs to be said. 
- [The Man Who Loved Only Numbers](https://amzn.to/3hDkRbU) - Paul Hoffman - 
- [Adventures of a Mathematician](https://amzn.to/2QtLfK6) - Stanislaw Ulam - 

## Techniques of Invention

### Programming
**Books**
- [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://amzn.to/3y9ZrJb) - David Thomas and Andrew Hunt - 
- [Thinking Forth](https://amzn.to/2SQZBVP) - Leo Brodie - 
- [Coders at Work](https://amzn.to/3hq63gy) - Peter Seibel - A series of interviews with a group of very talented coders. Lots of the technical specifics already feel quite dated in the book, but I think there's a ton of great information about how these people go about reading and writing code. How they debug and tackle a problem is really interesting to read about. 
- [Sunburst and Luminary](https://amzn.to/3hIyPcL) - Don Eyles - So many of the embedded programming techiques used today were first developed during the Apollo program. Here you can read about the whole process put together by a young man with some supervision and no real programming experience. Watchdog timers, priority execution, and all sorts of wonderful detail about how the LEM landed on the moon.  
- [The Making of Prince of Persia](https://amzn.to/3yhZtPc) - Jordan Mechner - Prince of Persia was a really impressive game, made even more impressive by the fact that it's the creation of a single person. Lots of fascinating technical details about how the look and feel of the game was achieved, and tons of information about how slow and interrupted the creative process feels. Straight from his diaries while he was writing the game this book is great to read. 

### Math
**Books**
- [A Programmer's Introduction to Mathematics](https://amzn.to/3tMix4L) - Jeremy Kun - I've read through 3/4 (8/10? Something like that) of this book. I've also done none of the exercises (my kingdom for an answer key!). A very nice read, in particular I really enjoyed the derivation of the wave equation and the general conversational tone of the book. Very reassuring to hear that yes learning new math is supposed to be slow. 
- [Linear and Geometric Algebra](https://amzn.to/33JlI2B) - Dr. Alan Macdonald - I struggled in my first Linear Algebra course and just scraped through. I read most of this book over the course of a summer. I took my time and would work through the exercises as described, and for the first time, things like a basis and span and all these technical definitions really started to click! I keep meaning to finish the book and work through the second volume on vector and geometric calculus. 
- [Quick Calculus](https://amzn.to/3uSLEVp) - Daniel Kleppner and Norman Ramsey - I worked through this calculus book the summer after graduating from SAIT based on a recommendation in the Art of Electronics. Very well done and a nice review.
- [Calculus Made Easy](https://calculusmadeeasy.org/) - Silvanus P. Thompson - One of the best teaching books I've ever read. I worked through the whole book in the fall of 2017, it was a wonderful review and provided some of the best intuitive ways of thinking about the integral and derivative as a beginner. If you want to refresh your calculus or learn it for the first time, there is no better book. 
- [Logicomix](https://amzn.to/3hvA3Ia) - Apostolos Doxiadis and Christos Papadimitriou - This is a nice, but historically inaccurate (it's still very good!), overview of the advances in logic that took place between Bertrand Russell and Kurt Godel in the early part of the 20th century. If you want a layman's introduction to the whole debate it's hard to do better. Find out what his incompleteness theorem is in general terms! 
- [A History of Pi](https://amzn.to/3tTc20b) - Petr Beckmann - The author has since veered off in to conspiratorial waters but this book is a wonderful history of how humanity has gotten better at calculating pi. Mathematics is the technology of thought and so advancement in computation in some vague sense also represents progress in mathematical technology. 
- [e The Story of a Number](https://amzn.to/3tVfLdE) - Eli Maor - e is this weird constant that pops up when you're learning calculus. I didn't get why it was the way it was, or it's relation to logarithms and exponentials. So I read this book which is filled with lots of context about how these concepts came to be. Very much worth reading for the the historical detail alone. The math wasn't too bad at all and I found it really enlightening. 
- [Who is Fourier?](https://amzn.to/3tUYl0G) - Transnational College of Lex - I think along with Calculus Made Easy this book deserves a real spot on the shelf of anyone who wants to know how to write an easily understandable mathematics text. Written in a conversational form, by a group of people documenting their investigation of the Fourier transform the book covers both discrete and continuous cases and also for good measure has a fantastic explantion of the fast fourier transform. 
- [Birth of a Theorem](https://amzn.to/3bwdsaq) - Cedric Villani - How does a top flight research mathematician (he won a fields medal) pursue research? Well here's a memoir straight from the horse's mouth. He discusses how he does his research, it's collaborative, and sometimes he lies on the floor of his office to clear his mind. I enjoyed reading it. 
- [How to Study for a Mathematics Degree](https://amzn.to/3v0JDqg) - Dr. Lara Alcock - This was a very reassuring book for me to read. I think math is often very intimidating and confusing, and this guide helped minimize a lot of that intimidation for me. It's especially useful for when you're trying to crack into harder maths papers, she explains lots of the cultural context of math. 
- [A Mind for Numbers](https://amzn.to/2SXbVUx) - Dr. Barbara Oakley - This book is sort of a current summary of the best research about how to learn. Lots of info about chunking, how to focus (love the Pomodoro technique!) and tons of other great tidbits. Super handy for any student. 
- [Blackjack Play like the Pros](https://amzn.to/2QG60Cz) - John Bukofsky - Card counting is really interesting, it's not as lucrative as it used to be, because Casinos can do math too and have figured out how to reduce the edge. It can still be profitable though, if you have the willingness to practice it enough to get an edge. I don't, but reading through this book and playing with some cards sure taught me a lot about the practical application of probability to the real world. 
- [The Collapse of Chaos](https://amzn.to/342ITVI) - Jack Cohen and Ian Stewart - 

**Papers**
- [Ten Lessons I Wish I Had Learned Before Teaching Differential Equations](https://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/lg5/Rota.pdf) - Gian Carlo Rota - A classic essay on what is important to teach in ODE's and what isn't. Very nice for a bit more context around math.
- [A Revolution in Mathematics? What Really Happened a Century Ago](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265069621_A_Revolution_in_Mathematics_What_Really_Happened_a_Century_Ago_and_Why_It_Matters_Today) - Frank Quinn - 
- [Classical Roots of Knot Theory](https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.library.uvic.ca/science/article/pii/S0960077997001070) - Jozef H Przytycki - 
- [What are the most important statistical ideas of the past 50 years](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00174) - Andrew Gelman and Aki Vehtari - 
- [Geometric Algebra Primer](https://issuu.com/jaapsuter/docs/geometric-algebra) - Jaap Suter - This is a really concise introduction to geometric algebra. If you're looking to get an overview of the mathematical mechanics involved and how all the bits fit together I think this is the place to sart. 
- [A History of Vector Analysis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/244957729_A_History_of_Vector_Analysis) - Michael J Crowe - 
- [Imaginary Numbers are Not Real](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226188504_Imaginary_numbers_are_not_real-The_geometric_algebra_of_spacetime) - Stephen Gull, Anthony Lasenby, Chris Doran - 
- [The Markov Chain Monte Carlo Revolution](https://math.uchicago.edu/~shmuel/Network-course-readings/MCMCRev.pdf) - Persi Diaconis -
- [Off to Infinity in Finite Time](https://www.ams.org/notices/199505/saari-2.pdf) - Donald G Saari and Zhihong Xia - 
- [Knot Theory's Odd Origins](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/silver.pdf) - Daniel S. Silver -
- [Knot Theory for 8 Year Olds](https://www.atm.org.uk/write/MediaUploads/Journals/MT264/MT26414.pdf) - Dan Ghica - 
- [Some elements for a history of the dynamical systems theory](https://aip-scitation-org.ezproxy.library.uvic.ca/doi/pdf/10.1063/5.0047851) - Multiple Contributors - I always like reading overviews of fields since they provide a ton of context that I as an outsider miss. Lots of little tidbits in this one, for example I found out about the Chirikov Criterion here!

**Courses**
- [Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycJEoqmQvwg&list=PLbN57C5Zdl6j_qJA-pARJnKsmROzPnO9V) -Dr. Steven Strogatz - I found this series hugely helpful when I was working through the material in my Intermediate Ordinary Differential Equations course at UVic. I haven't watched every single video, but I've been through most. The associated textbook is very good as well. 
- [The Fourier Transform and its Applications](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/EE261) - Dr. Brad Osgood - I ran through all of these lectures in the summer of 2020 and took notes after they were recommended by Jeremy Kun in his book. They're a great series and placed the Fourier Transform in context for me. 
- [Topology and Geometry](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTBqohhFNBE_09L0i-lf3fYXF5woAbrzJ) - Dr. Tadashi Tokieda - A fantastic course and a very good introduction to Topology. Again, I watched all the videos and took notes. It familiarized me with the field and also provided tremendous insight in to what mathematics really is and how it operates. To quote Dr. Tokieda: "that's what mathematics is, an analogy". 
- [Differential Forms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaWj0WxUxGg&list=PL22w63XsKjqzQZtDZO_9s2HEMRJnaOTX7&index=1) - Dr. Michael Penn - A great overview of differential forms that I completed in the spring of 2021. There's some hints that more videos might be added in the future, but currently it was a great introduction to modern methods of expressing Maxwell's Equations. 
- [Particle in Cell Fundamentals](https://www.particleincell.com/pic-fundamentals/) - - A great introduction to particle in cell simulations for plasmas. I was able to purchase the course as a student at a discount for $25. I took notes of all the videos and it was a great help for writing my own initial PIC simulation. 
- [Center Manifolds, Normal Forms and Bifurcations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUeHTafWecAVblNx278wBxkIQXw7iJws3) - Dr. Shane Ross - Have finished this series and really enjoyed it. Not too long (only 10 videos), and it filled in some gaps that weren't possible to cover given time constraints in my intermediate ODE's course. Lots of neat new things about manifolds and normal forms!
- [Imaginary Numbers are Real](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiaHhY2iBX9g6KIvZ_703G3KJXapKkNaF) - Welch Labs - Complex numbers appear everywhere in electrical engineering and since I didn't feel especially confident with them after completing my SAIT diploma, I worked through this series of videos along with the associated workbook. A wonderful short tutorial on complex numbers that goes all the way up to advanced concepts and lets you dip your toe in to some fascinating mathematics. 

**Websites**
- [Lee Lady's Mathematical Website](http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~lee/) - Dr. Lee Lady - A great website that provides a ton of context about learning math. In particular his descriptions of how he proved some of his theorems early on, and general commentary about how to teach and learn math is invaluable. His essay on "How to do Mathematical Research" is worth reading repeatedly.
 

### Engineering
**Books**
- [Debugging](https://amzn.to/3uO93HJ) - David Agans - This book is supposedly specific to programming, but it's rules for debugging are applicable to all sorts of technical problems. Very nice quick and easy read and filled with practical advice. 
- [Ignition!](https://amzn.to/3uPSjzM) - John Drury Clark - Once a problem field has been defined, say fuels for rocket engines, how does one go about finding all the possible fuels and categorizing them? Sometimes very crudely, and sometimes very elegantly. This is a great book about the practice of chemistry in the service of a tightly defined task and all the trials and tribulations that go along with that. 
- [To Engineer is Human](https://amzn.to/3uK9NgO) - Henry Petroski - The body of knowledge engineer's use to design structures and technology is very often written in the mistakes of past engineers. Lots of case studies and examinations of successes and failures. 
- [Invention by Design](https://amzn.to/3eJKRR4) - Henry Petroski - Again a series of case studies, but specific to technological items. The current general paradigm seems to me to be that some scientists invent some new theory, and then it is applied by engineers. I don't think that's correct, I think theory has to be rooted in something physical or it sort of eats itself (see String Theory). Here some very pedestrian and not so pedestrian pieces of technology are investigated and the process that brought them to be is described. 
- [The Art of Doing Science and Engineering]() - Richard Hamming - Stripe Press has been on a role with it's republishing of classic books. I need to re-read the mathematical sections on Hamming Encoding, but this book is fantastic. Lots of tips and encouragement about how to push forward and expand the frontiers of knowledge from someone who was able to do just that. 
- [Spacesuit](https://amzn.to/3fnHfTV) - Nicholas de Monchaux - Words like bespoke and handcrafted seem inappropriate for things like the space program, but nothing could be further from the truth. Enter this fascinating, but academically written, monograph on the development of the spacesuit for the Apollo missions. Given the choice between a dedicated aerospace engineering firm and a company mostly known for making corsets and bras, who do you think would be better placed to make a spacesuit? The answer lies within this book!
- [Accidental Engineer](https://amzn.to/3uUqmqj) - Ray Holt w/ Leo Sorge - Perhaps this belongs in the biography section, but its a very short read, just under 80 pages. It details the inventor of the first real microprocessor Ray Holt. Fresh out of university, with a single course in the subject under his belt, he designed from scratch a flight computer for the magnificent F-14 Tomcat. Some of the techniques and ideas he used were still bleeding edge nearly 50 years later in 2010. Intel's claims with calculator circuits pales in comparison. Really shows you what people can do when they hold themselves to a high standard. 
- [The Hardware Hacker](https://amzn.to/2TaH8nl) - Bunnie Huang - So you want to make an electronic doodad yourself but don't have a good idea of the process? Read this book, it covers everything, prototyping, BOM's, talking to factories, test jigs. It's all here. 

**Interviews**
- [Jim Keller: Moore's Law - Lex Friedman's Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb2tebYAaOA) - Microprocessors and silicon ciruits are one of the few places where the pace of technological change has been quite steady. I'm not confident that that's a model that is generalizable to lots of other arenas, but it brings with it a whole host of challenges. Jim Keller has been at the centre of this change in microprocessor's since the 1980's so he's been able to see the field change for a long time, and has driven quite a bit of that change himself. This interview with Lex Friedman is just filled with tons of interesting information.

### Finance
The inclusion of finance might seem a little curious, but I think it's a hugely important place to read about invention and in particular the application and misapplication of mathematical models to reality. I would also note that I think a lot of very talented people have sniffed out the rot in modern Academia (from the 70's on), and Wall St. has long been willing to pay people a lot of money for their talents. It's always worthwhile to read smart people, and so you put two and two together and you end up here. 

**Books**
- [My Life as a Quant](https://amzn.to/3uSggpW) - Emanuel Derman - A biography of a mathematical modeller originally from South Africa who came to finance by way of physics. Its generally interesting but also provides some specific colour about how and why Wall St really mathematized from the 70's onwards.
- [When Genius Failed](https://amzn.to/2RPBKFs) - Roger Lowenstein - Classic case study of a mismatch between a mathematical trading model and reality. It very nearly broke the markets in 1998, and foreshadows a lot of the problems that happened later on in 2008. Very much worth reading. 
- [Models Behaving Badly](https://amzn.to/3tO4N9I) - Emanuel Derman - A wonderful polemic about how people should use math to model things and how they should not. The author has spent a lot of time thinking about these things and it shows. Very much worth reading for people who are interested in how science can go wrong. I would be curious to know Dr. Derman's thoughts on Sabine Hossenfelder's most recent book, Lost in Math. 
- [Unknown Market Wizards](https://amzn.to/3eOKa9i) - Jack D Schwager - Is it possible to beat the market? Yes, but you're probably not going to do it. Here is a series of interviews with individual traders who have a long track record of continued success. I think there are a lot of lessons for people who want to find success in science here. You're trying to extract a signal from an incredibly noisy environment in science, a similar dynamic is underway with market traders. How do they succeed? 
- [Fooled by Randomness](https://amzn.to/3btDhrH) - Nicholas Nassim Taleb - 
- [The Black Swan](https://amzn.to/3w7NDW0) - Nicholas Nassim Taleb -
- [Antifragile](https://amzn.to/33K8pyW) - Nicholas Nassim Taleb -
- [The Poker Face of Wall St.](https://amzn.to/2RFVJXj) - Aaron Brown - I really liked this book, lots of ways of looking at risk in investing through the frame of successful gamblers. A very neat historical fact was teased regarding the Yukon gold rush, poker there was some sort of local pool of winnings that allowed a member of the poker players group to make enough to actually leave. You couldn't play at the table unless you'd put your time in looking for gold. Super neat local credit structure. 
- [A Man for All Markets](https://amzn.to/3fDTUSU) - Dr. Edward Thorpe -

**Interviews**
- [The Portal - Roger Penrose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg93Dm-vYc8) - I normally try and listen to podcasts that are in the interviewer's area of expertise since they tend to be most interesting (Joe Rogan on fighting and comedy for example, less so on other stuff), and this is one of the few interviews with a mathematical physicist that didn't drive me absolutely bananas. Wonderful to listen to a Nobel prize winner discuss mathematics on a level that isn't just for the layman, very enlightening even if I couldn't follow a lot of it. 
 

**Books**
- [Life at the Center of the Energy Crisis](https://amzn.to/3hsr5es) - Dr. George H. Miley - 
- [Inertial Electrostatic Confinement Fusion](https://amzn.to/3tWZZPz) - Dr. George H. Miley and Dr. S. Krupakar Murali - 
- [Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps](https://amzn.to/3fpc0HU) - Peter Galison - I found this book difficult to read, but it is filled with the most wonderful information. Why did Einstein use a train for his gedankenexperiment? Maybe it was because he was a patent clerk reviewing patent applications for clocks to synchronize train schedules across Switzerland. Deeply important to read to understand how theory is subordinate to the real engineering problems of the physical world. 
- [Models of the Atomic Nucleus](https://amzn.to/2Rhmlhp) - Norman D Cook -

**Websites**
- [Scott Locklin's Blog](https://scottlocklin.wordpress.com/) - Dr. Scott Locklin - I can't remember when I stumbled on this blog, but I read it every time something new goes up. Lots of different things, always a unique viewpoint and points are made in the best, most brutal fashion. I've been introduced to a lot of new ideas via the blog, one of my favourite posts is the [following](https://scottlocklin.wordpress.com/2013/03/07/the-enigma-of-the-ford-paradox/) on chaos and the Ford paradox. 
- [Fusor.net](https://fusor.net/) - I've mentioned this elsewhere but in particular I'd like to highlight some of the [threads](https://fusor.net/board/viewforum.php?f=70&sid=5f110db5244fcd230c14c2ea0e675014) on the history of the fusor. These are first hand interviews Richard Hull undertook with many of the original fusor team at ITT. There's just no other way to hear about this stuff since many of them have since passed on. Absolutely worth reading. 
- [The Herbert Dingle Affair](https://planetofstorms.wordpress.com/2021/02/13/the-herbert-dingle-affair/) - How do you know what is true? Surely science filters the wheat from the chaff and lets you triangulate what is correct?
