## Research and Reading

I've been doing a lot of reading and research regarding the Fusor. I have some things I want to try with it, rather than just simply ticking the box on achieving fusion, and that means I need some new ideas. This page is a listing of information, math, videos, books, articles etc. that I have read and I think are generally pertinent towards this goal. I'm really not too sure how to organize all this, it's not like I have some sort of system setup, basically if I think a bit of information is interesting I read/watch/engage with it and then I put it up here. Included are things about modern science, ancient science, mathematics, hoaxes, frauds, engineering, sociology, and on and on.
