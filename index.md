## Research and Reading

I've been doing a lot of reading and research regarding the Fusor. I have some things I want to try with it, rather than just simply ticking the box on achieving fusion, and that means I need some new ideas. This page is a listing of information, math, videos, books, articles etc. that I have read and I think are generally pertinent towards this goal. I'm really not too sure how to organize all this, it's not like I have some sort of system setup, basically if I think a bit of information is interesting I read/watch/engage with it and then I put it up here. Included are things about modern science, ancient science, mathematics, hoaxes, frauds, engineering, sociology, and on and on. I'm slowly adding everything I've done so far, and I'll try to include short comments where appropriate, but as of right now the list is incomplete! Rest assured I found everything here interesting. 

Currently Reading - [The Forgotten Revolution: How Science Was Born in 300 BC and Why it Had to be Reborn](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/3540200681/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=15121&creative=330641&creativeASIN=3540200681&linkCode=as2&tag=nkrause-20&linkId=6b1b4303ea4c2b0ac45a1005db0a5e8c)

## How Does Invention Occur?
- [Everything is a Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPERZDfyWc) - Kirby Ferguson - A wonderful video about how the essence of creativity and innovation is recombination. I have watched this multiple times. 

### History + Sociology

### Biography - Auto and Otherwise
- [To Mars With Love](https://www.tomarswithlove.com/) - Patricia Ann Straat - A wonderful story about the development of one of the life detection experiments on the Viking Lander. Known as the Labelled Release experiment, this book details its design and invention and lays out the case that life was actually detected by the device. Sadly the author passed away in October of last year, this whole book is fascinating and deserves to be more widely read.

## Techniques of Invention

### Programming
- [The Pragmatic Programmer]()
- [Thinking Forth]()
- [Coders at Work]()

### Math
- [Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycJEoqmQvwg&list=PLbN57C5Zdl6j_qJA-pARJnKsmROzPnO9V) -Dr. Steven Strogatz - I found this series hugely helpful when I was working through the material in my Intermediate Ordinary Differential Equations course at UVic. I haven't watched every single video, but I've been through most. The associated textbook is very good as well. 
- [The Fourier Transform and its Applications](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/EE261) - Dr. Brad Osgood - I ran through all of these lectures in the summer of 2020 and took notes after they were recommended by Jeremy Kun in his book. They're a great series and placed the Fourier Transform in context for me. 
- [Topology and Geometry](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTBqohhFNBE_09L0i-lf3fYXF5woAbrzJ) - Dr. Tadashi Tokieda - A fantastic course and a very good introduction to Topology. Again, I watched all the videos and took notes. It familiarized me with the field and also provided tremendous insight in to what mathematics really is and how it operates. To quote Dr. Tokieda: "that's what mathematics is, an analogy". 
- [Differential Forms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaWj0WxUxGg&list=PL22w63XsKjqzQZtDZO_9s2HEMRJnaOTX7&index=1) - Dr. Michael Penn - A great overview of differential forms that I completed in the spring of 2021. There's some hints that more videos might be added in the future, but currently it was a great introduction to modern methods of expressing Maxwell's Equations. 
- [Particle in Cell Fundamentals](https://www.particleincell.com/pic-fundamentals/) - - A great introduction to particle in cell simulations for plasmas. I was able to purchase the course as a student at a discount for $25. I took notes of all the videos and it was a great help for writing my own initial PIC simulation. 
- [Center Manifolds, Normal Forms and Bifurcations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUeHTafWecAVblNx278wBxkIQXw7iJws3) - Dr. Shane Ross - Currently halfway through this series of videos taking notes as I go.

### Engineering
- [Debugging]()
- [Ignition!]()
- [To Engineer is Human]()
- [Invention by Design]()

### Finance
The inclusion of finance might seem a little curious, but I think it's a hugely important place to read about invention and in particular the application and misapplication of mathematical models to reality. I would also note that I think a lot of very talented people have sniffed out the rot in modern Academia (from the 70's on), and Wall St. has long been willing to pay people a lot of money for their talents. It's always worthwhile to read smart people, and so you put two and two together and you end up here.
